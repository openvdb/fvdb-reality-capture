class ShOrderingMode(str, Enum):
    """
    Enum representing spherical harmonics ordering modes used by Gaussian splats.
    Spherical harmonics for Gaussian splatting can be stored differently in memory depending on the application. For example,
    PLY files store spherical harmonics in ``RRR_GGG_BBB`` order, while some rendering codes
    (including ``fvdb_reality_capture.GaussianSplat3d``) use ``RGB_RGB_RGB`` order.

    This enum defines two common ordering modes:

    - ``RGB_RGB_RGB``: The feature channels are interleaved for each coefficient. *i.e.* The spherical harmonics
      tensor corresponds to a (row-major) contiguous tensor of shape ``[num_coefficients, num_sh_bases, channels]``, where channels=3 for RGB.
    - ``RRR_GGG_BBB``: The feature channels are stored in separate blocks for each coefficient. *i.e.* The spherical harmonics
      tensor corresponds to a (row-major) contiguous tensor of shape ``[num_coefficients, channels, num_sh_bases]``, where channels=3 for RGB.

      coefficients are provided, FVDB expects a packed layout:
